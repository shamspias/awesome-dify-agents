## Ground Rules

- **Be respectful**. We value inclusive and constructive discussions.
- **Search first**. Check the [issues](../../issues) and existing PRs to avoid duplicates.
- **Small PRs > big PRs**. Incremental changes are easier to review and merge.
- **Keep it public-domain friendly**. Prefer open-source models, datasets, and APIs where possible.

## Adding a New Flow

1. **Fork** the repo and create a new branch  
   ```bash
   git checkout -b feat/my-awesome-flow
   ```

2. **Place your `.yml`** under the correct top-level folder:

   ```
   flows/
   ‚îú‚îÄ agents/
   ‚îú‚îÄ chatbots/
   ‚îî‚îÄ chatflows/
      ‚îú‚îÄ rag/
      ‚îú‚îÄ integrations/
      ‚îî‚îÄ utilities/

   
   ```

   > If none fits, propose a new folder in your PR description.
3. **Name the file** with lowercase and dashes, e.g. `pdf-summarizer.yml`.
4. **Add a mini-README** inside the same folder:

   * What the flow does (one-liner)
   * Required models & keys
   * Screenshot or Mermaid diagram (optional)
5. **Test import** on the latest stable Dify release. The flow should:

   * Import without errors ‚úîÔ∏è
   * Contain no hard-coded secrets üîë
   * Produce a sensible response with default settings üß™
6. **Commit** both YAML and README:

   ```bash
   git add flows/<folder>/pdf-summarizer.yml flows/<folder>/README.md
   git commit -m "feat: add pdf summarizer flow"
   ```
7. **Push & open a PR**. Use the **‚ÄúFlow Submission‚Äù** PR template and fill in all fields.

| **Images**     | `.png` or `.webp`, ‚â§ 500 KB, commit in the same folder |

## Local Testing

```bash
# 1. Clone your fork

# 2. (Optional) Enable pre-commit hooks

# 3. Lint the repo
