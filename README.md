## What is Dify?

[Dify](https://github.com/langgenius/dify) is an open-source LLM application platform that combines **agentic workflows, RAG pipelines, model management, and observability** in one UI/SDK, letting you go from prototype to production fast. :contentReference[oaicite:0]{index=0}  
Its **DSL** (a YAML-based standard) lets you export or import entire app configurations, including prompts, nodes, and model parameters. :contentReference[oaicite:1]{index=1}

## Purpose of this repository

1. **Preserve**: Back up interesting chatflows & workflows in version control.  
2. **Discover**: Browse ready-made agents, RAG examples, tool integrations, and UI tweaks.  
3. **Learn**: Compare design patterns, node chains, and prompt engineering tricks.  
4. **Reuse**: Fork, import, and adapt flows into your own Dify instance in seconds.

## Directory structure

```

flows/
‚îú‚îÄ agents/          # autonomous or multi-agent examples
‚îú‚îÄ chatbots/        # conversational flows
‚îú‚îÄ rag/             # retrieval-augmented generation setups
‚îú‚îÄ integrations/    # 3rd-party API or plugin demos
‚îî‚îÄ utilities/       # helper nodes, memory tools, etc.

```

Each sub-folder contains one or more `*.yml` DSL files plus a short `README` describing:

* **Goal** ‚Äì what the flow does  
* **Models tested** ‚Äì e.g. GPT-4o, Claude 3, Gemini 1.5  
* **Special nodes** ‚Äì file upload, call-function, eval, etc.  
* **Screenshot / diagram** (optional)
